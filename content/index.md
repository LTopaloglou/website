Hi! I'm a 4th year CS student at the University of Waterloo. I am currently working as an ML/Software Engineering Intern at Arteria AI. On the weekends, I am working on an app with my friends Josh and Dan. I spend my free time grappling, cooking, watching soccer and (occasionally) playing video games.
